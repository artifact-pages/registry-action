# Artifact Pages registry sync

Reconciles the Artifact Pages site registry with the complete `sites` mapping of the admin deployment config (`artifact-pages registry sync`). It adds and updates configured sites and removes omitted sites from discovery, including cleaning their published content. A retry resumes any cleanup left by a partial failure. Run it from a protected admin workflow.

## Usage

```yaml
steps:
  # ... configure provider credentials ...
  - uses: artifact-pages/registry-action@v0.1.0
    with:
      config: artifact-pages.yaml
```

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config` | empty | Deployment config path or `github://` locator; empty uses `artifact-pages.yaml` in the workspace. |
| `cli-version` | empty | Exact supported CLI override; environment overrides take precedence. |
| `github-token` | `github.token` | Read-only token for a separate private config repository. |
| `dry-run` | `false` | Plan without writes. |
| `publish-on` | empty | Newline-separated `event` or `event:ref` entries; a run matching none becomes a dry-run. |
| `summary` | `true` | Append the operation summary to the Job Summary. |
| `checkout` | `auto` | Run `actions/checkout` when the workspace is not a Git checkout (`true` always, `false` never). |
| `fetch-depth` | `1` | Depth of that checkout; the CLI deepens a shallow checkout on demand. |

## Outputs

`operation`, `outcome` (`planned`, `synced`, `no-op` or `failed`), `registry-updated` (`true` or `false`), `changes` (JSON array), `result`, `exit-code` and `error`.

## Version and runners

The Action version describes its wrapper. Its generated `release.json` declares a checksum-verified bootstrap CLI and the supported range `>=0.1.0 <0.2.0`. The bootstrap resolves `cli.version` from the deployment config; `cli-version` can override it within that range without bypassing compatibility checks. The Job Summary records the actual CLI and any override, including failed operations. CLI downloads use only official Artifact Pages releases and the workflow token; the private-config token is never used for downloads.

Supported runners: Linux and macOS, x64 and arm64. Windows runners are not supported.
